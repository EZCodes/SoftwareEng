<h1> Description of the graph </h1>
<main> This graph compares Microsoft and Google Open Source involvement, as well as compares their engagements in those projects </br>
The sizes are proportional to amount of lines committed to the respective repositories. </br>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li>Amount of repositories</li>
  <li>Amount of lines on all repositories</li>
  <li>Lines of code committed by employees and lines of code committed by non-employees of respective company </li>
  <li>Lines committed in specific languages by either employees or non employees</li>
</ul> 
These metrics allow us to see a lot of things. First we can see how involved in open source are these two companies in comparison to each other </br>
We can also check how engaged companies are. If a company have more non-employees committing the their repositories, that means that they are not engaged </be>
and just leaving it to people from outside. </br>
We can also see if there's difference between languages of employees or non-employees. </br>
It might be the case that employees will commit in languages that this company developed, while non-emlpoyees will commit in something else </br>
We are able to check, what are the main languages of the company repositories, and compare that to above metrics </br>

<h2> Summarizing </h2>
This graph allows us to compare engagement in open source between Microsoft and Google and the tools that they are use or allow to use. </br>

<h1> Analysis of Data </h1>

As we can see on the graph, Microsoft has way more Open Source Projects than Google. However, both companies tend to leave the projects in the hands of non-employees </br>
It does make sense, since they probably have more important internal projects to do instead. In terms of languages it seems like that for Microsoft projects the most common are </br>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li>C++</li>
	<li>C</li>
	<li>A bit of Java and JavaScript</li>
	<li>Combination of other, less common languages</li>
</ul>
Its good to note that Employees and Non-Employees use similar languages, with exception of JavaScript, which is not popular amongst employees </br>
</br>
In case of Google, the languages are:
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
	<li>JavaScript</li>
	<li>Python</li>
	<li>C</li>
	<li>HTML</li>
	<li>Bit of Java</li>
	<li>Large presence of other, less common languages</li>
</ul>
It also should be noted, that while these are most used languages, Employees only tend to use Java, while the rest of the languages is committed mostly by Non-Employees </br>
